# CSS Architecture Challenge

**css-architecture-challenge** is a code challenge for frontend developers applying for a job at IT Tick.

## Scenario

So here you are! You decided to apply for a job at IT Tick and now we are asking you to help us with a simple website styling.
We already setup a brand new project for you that already contains a very basic structure and setup. Your task is to finish the website by adding responsivity and apply a better CSS structure.

## Technical starting point

Our team was already able to complete the following:

* Add the basic app structure
* Setup build script and development server using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
* Add `node-sass`

## Mission

* [ ] Fork this repository
* [ ] Use [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) for css selectors.
* [ ] Apply a modular CSS file architecture (We recommend [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/)).
* [ ] Make the website responsive for extra small devices up to extra large screens (Do NOT use a framework!)
* [ ] Submit a merge request and describe your changes precisely

## Bonus

* [ ] Add form validations.
* Create Extra pages using the same styles (using dummy content)
  * [ ] Contacts page
  * [ ] About page
  * [ ] Privacy page
  * [ ] Cookies page

## Please note

* Write concise commit messages
* Do NOT use any CSS framework or library, write your own styles.
* Pay attention for responsive design even for extra large screens.
* Use semantic elements when possible.
* Display well in Google Chrome, Firefox, IE11 and Safari

## Feel free to

* Clean styles / Improve design to have better UI and UX.
* Re-organize the codebase.
* Edit `gulp` configurations.
* Modify existing code.
* Add new packages.
* Add tests
* Edit `README.md` to add documentation.
* Fix potential bugs

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Start development server

```bash
yarn start
```

### Build website

```bash
yarn build
```
